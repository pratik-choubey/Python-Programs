# GCD of two number:-(Greatest common divisor)
'''-->A simple solution is to find all prime factors of both numbers,
then find intersection of all factors present in both numbers. 
Finally return product of elements in the intersection.
-->An efficient solution is to use "Euclidean algorithm" which is the
main algorithm used for this purpose. The idea is, GCD of two numbers
doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number.'''
